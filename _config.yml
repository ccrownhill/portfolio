  - "I am an autodidact, interested in everything from psychology to software
    development."
  - "\"what I cannot create, I do not understand\" (Richard Feynman) is the guiding
    principle for my projects, as they seek to teach me by building as much
    as possible from scratch without relying on big libraries."
