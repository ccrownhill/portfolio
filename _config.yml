about_paragraphs:
  - "I am an autodidact, interested in everything from psychology to software
    development."
  - "The guiding principle to all these self-teaching projects is
    \"what I cannot create, I do not understand\" (Richard Feynman) as they seek to build as much
    as possible from scratch without relying on big libraries."
